*Note: Both links should work fine. The new link is just more condensed and clean.*

# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
I can't get a Dires server up due to their free nodes out of stock and I dont have a way of paying for their higher servers yet. So Nyxx can only be online by me running the main py file on VS Code

# If we have problems with Nyxx, how can we reach you?
There are two ways:
- My Discord: **fwdrxyy_**
- Or my GitHub email: **drxygithub@gmail.com**

# Any questions to ask?
Feel free to dm me on discord! Or, email me! my Discord and Email are in the section above this one.
