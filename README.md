# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
Unfortunately, I can't find an affordable service to host my bot, nor host it myself, because I cant spend my money at the moment. if you guys find a service for please dm me on Discord

# How can I get my logs working?
Since the logging part in **Moderation.py** requires the server ID and channel ID, you'll need to enable Dev Mode in settings. (A Screenshot will be added later.) To get the channel ID, right-click your #logs channel and find the button "Copy Channel ID," then paste it into the parts of the code where it asks for it. 

To get the server ID, right-click the server name and scroll until you see "Security Actions" or something similar. You'll see the button "Copy Server ID," then paste it into the code where it's asking for the server ID
