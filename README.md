# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
Unfortunately, I can't find an affordable service to host my bot, nor host it myself, because I cant spend my money at the moment. if you guys find a service for please dm me on Discord. 

I can only run her when Im in VS Code. So expect her not to run all the time

# How can I get my logs working?
Since the logging part has it's own cog now. Nyxx will find a log channel in your server to send the logs in. If she cant find one, she will select a random private channel. **Common names are: logs, mod-log, admin-log, server-log**.

To get a channel ID, first you'll need to turn on Dev Mode. (You can look that up) Once you have that, hover over the channel you want to copy the ID from. Right click the channel. A few options down should be an option called "Copy Channel ID". click that and paste it IN YOUR OWN CODE where its asking for channel ID
