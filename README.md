# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
Unfortunately, I can't find an affordable service to host my bot, nor host it myself, because I cant spend my money at the moment. if you guys find a service for please dm me on Discord

# How can I get my logs working?
Since the logging part has it's own cog now. Nyxx will find a log channel in your server to send the logs in. If she cant find one, it will select a random private channel.

To get the server ID, right-click the server name and scroll until you see "Security Actions" or something similar. You'll see the button "Copy Server ID," then paste it into the code where it's asking for the server ID
