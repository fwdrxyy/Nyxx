# Nyxx is offline. Why is that?
I can't get a Dires server up due to their free nodes out of stock and I dont have a way of paying for their higher servers yet. So Nyxx can only be online by me running the main py file on VS Code

# How can I get my logs working?
Since the logging part in **Moderation.py** requires the server ID and channel ID, you'll need to enable Dev Mode in settings (Screenshot will be added later) To get the channel ID, Right click the your #logs channel and find the button "Copy Channel ID" then paste into the parts of the code where its asking for channel ID. 

To get the server ID, right click the server name, scroll all the down until you see "Security Actions" or something simular. You'll see the button "Copy Server ID" then paste into the code where its asking for the server ID

# If we have problems with Nyxx, how can we reach you?
